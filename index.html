<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6060" title="friendship linda steele" src="friendship-linda-steele.jpg" alt="girlfriend guru,friendship recipe, baking for the holidays" width="232" height="230"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong><span style="font-family: georgia,bookman old style,palatino linotype,book antiqua,palatino,trebuchet ms,helvetica,garamond,sans-serif,arial,verdana,avante garde,century gothic,comic sans ms,times,times new roman,serif;">Food is an important part of a balanced diet.  ~Fran Lebowitz</span></strong></span></p>
<h2>There’s a wonderful cafe in Manhattan called Popovers. It’s at the corner of Amsterdam and 86th Street and is where I learned the Joy of eating a popover. Sometimes we’d eat at the restaurant, but more often we’d get huge bagfuls of popovers with small containers of their wonderful strawberry butter and race back to eat them before the popovers cooled.</h2>
<p><strong>Super thanks to girlfriend guru LINDA MARIA STEELE for bringing back this memory (and the faces of everyone who joined in the popover-fest). There is something wonderful about food memories. As we approach the holiday season, I am determined to bake for some of my fab friends. Or at least meet them for a good cup of coffee. What are your plans for sharing holiday foods with your girlfriends?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>I hosted a lunch at my house last Monday</strong>. The temperature has been dropping so I decided to build a fire in the brick fireplace in my kitchen. I’m not sure how I would survive the winter without things like my friends and that fireplace. They both offer so much comfort and warmth. I made Spinach Feta Quiche, Popovers, and a Romaine, Mozzarella, Roma Tomato, and Balsamic Vinegar Salad. The popovers emerged from my oven light and fluffy. The more I make them I think the trick is a matter of whisking the eggs just right yet also leaving my oven door shut while they are rising. And not be tempted to check on them before they are done.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I recently read an article by Malcolm Gladwell called “Late Bloomers.” Gladwell’s got this amazing knack for weaving the most intimate anecdotes to tell thoughtful stories. In “Late Bloomers” he argues that it is just as likely (or even more so) for late bloomers—creative types to emerge and succeed later in life than a child genius. The idea is basically that <strong>it takes time and support from those around us to become who we are meant to become.</strong> I made a copy of the essay and gave it to my friend to read as she was leaving our lunch. She called later that day and said “Thank you for such a lovely article. It gives me hope and it brought a tear to my eye.”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I knew that article would be as meaningful to her as it was for me. There are creative endeavors we continue to work toward and support one another on and the article reminded us that it’s still possible to achieve our dreams. Hope is present. Another friend who’s about to submit her Masters Thesis in Literature appreciated the idea of a “Late Bloomer” too. It reminds us that even when there are so many other things like bills, laundry, and car pool to tend to as Moms we still must pursue our own creative interests and dreams. And offer support to one another along the way.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">With the Holidays fast approaching I realize I’ve got to get organized and fast! I love to create food items as gifts. I know one thing for sure is I’m going to make Christmas Snowflake Cupcakes and place in tiny festive cupcake holders. They are super simple and cute.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Each Holiday season something new enters our life</strong> based on the things my kids ask for as gifts. A couple of years ago it was my son’s Basketball Hoop that we put in the driveway. He’d shoot for hours and many of the neighborhood kids would stop by to shoot too. The year before that it was new guitars and guitar lessons for my two older children. This year it’s all things American Girl Doll (why do they have to be so expensive?) for Sophia. What I love about American Girl Doll is it’s something her friends are into right now too and they often come over with their dolls and accessories to play. I’ll hear them up in her room playing pretend for hours.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> As for the ear plugs, Bella’s been taking drum lessons and we found a great deal on a used and in excellent condition full set of drums. In my efforts to support Bella’s budding talent and interests, I agreed on the drums although I’ve decided all I’m asking Santa for this year for myself is a set of Ear Plugs!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I will leave you with some<strong> fun ideas for making Christmas Snowflake Cupcakes and Oreo Cookie Cupcakes</strong>. <img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7574" title="holiday cupcakes,girlfriend recipes" src="holiday-cupcakes-200x300.jpg" alt="baking for the holidays,oreo frosting holiday cupcakes" width="200" height="300">Photo is of samples of mini Oreo Cookie Cupcakes. And the photograph was taken by my daughter Bella. Bake a large batch of Cupcakes in various sizes: mini, medium and jumbo. Prepare your favorite frosting and separate portions in smaller bowls. Gather coconut and silver sugar sprinkles to use for the Christmas Snowflake Cupcakes. Crush fine Oreo cookies in a zip lock bag and gently stir into a portion of the plain white frosting. Spread on top of cupcakes. Use red food coloring to turn a small bowl set aside of the white frosting to dark pink or red. Spread the frosting thick onto Cupcakes and sprinkle with festive silver candy balls.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The idea is <strong>if you are going to create Food as Gift this holiday make it fun and festive</strong> and make a number of different options before placing in decorative holiday holders and Christmas tins. I<strong>nvite friends over to help with all the baking and decorating because beyond all the baking the true gifts around the holidays come from time spent with friends.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>LINDA STEELE </strong>knows how important maintaining supportive friendships are. She’s an avid baker, Professor, writer, and mom. Her first fun and personalized recipe collection called “Meet Me in My Cape Cod Kitchen” can now be purchased in e-book form on her blog. She loves to inspire people to always share fun times with friends while eating good food. You are invited to like her on Facebook at Sweeter by the Beach and become a follower of her blog. </p>

<h2>Every now and then it really pays to go back to the beginning. Even when we think we know something really well. Have you ever looked at a recipe you’ve been making from memory for years only to find out that there is an ingredient you’d forgotten or a different measure or…(this happens to me far more often than I care to admit).</h2>
<p><strong>Girlfriend guru and financial expert MIATA EDOGA has done the hard work of going back and explaining the basics of money. Whether you’re wondering where to start or need a refresher, this is the blog for you.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Someone the other day said, “Miata, I love your advice, but what about the basics?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“The basics?” I repeated. “I think I cover those, don’t I?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Unperturbed, she continued. “Why not have all the basics in one written piece?”</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’d never thought about that. So, if you’re wondering, “How do I start?” this one’s for you…and my friend.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Five Steps To Start Out On The Right Foot<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7463" title="Follow Financial Basics" src="Follow-Financial-Basics-300x200.jpg" alt="finance advice for starting out" width="300" height="200"></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1<strong>) Set up direct deposit</strong>. If there’s one mystery in life, it’s where money goes when you let it flow into your hand. To avoid this black hole, use direct deposit to a savings account, then have a portion moved every couple weeks to your checking account. Money should begin saving itself in your savings!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">2) <strong>Start your 401k</strong>. Albert Einstein described compounding interest as the most powerful force in the universe. Ultimately, you should use online calculators to decide the right amount to save, but at least save enough to grab whatever your employer will match. That’s free money in your hands.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">3) <strong>Open a Roth IRA</strong>…especially if you don’t have access to a 401k plan. Roth IRAs work the opposite of 401k plans. While the latter gives you tax breaks today, a Roth IRA provides tax free income during retirement. Need money for a house or education expenses down the road? In many cases, Roth IRA money can be used without penalty for these and other needs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">4) <strong>Evaluate your insurance needs</strong>. If you’re starting out, there’s a good chance that you need disability insurance to keep income coming in. Only buy life insurance if you have dependents that rely on your income, and then focus on “term insurance” coverage rather than more expensive whole life or universal policies.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">5<strong>) Pay down student loans, but slowly</strong>. When paying down debt, start with your highest interest rates and work down. Financial guru Dave Ramsey recommends using a debt snowball approach of paying the smallest balances first. While I agree that starting with small balances can help you pick up steam, large interest payments can kill your overall strategy. By balancing your approach, you’ll pay off your debt in no time.</p>

<br></span></p>
<h3>When we are little, we are regularly reminded to say thank you. “What do you say to Aunt Jenny?” someone will prompt. And “thank you” comes chorusing out. Sometimes we said it just to get to the ripping off the wrapping paper part of gift opening. Sometimes we really meant it.</h3>
<p><strong>As adults, we generally don’t have someone prompting us to say “thank you.” Oh, we now remember when someone hands us a gift or does us a favor (that’s been drilled into us after all!) but we don’t often take the time to be grateful. Girlfriend Guru Lisa Sarick reminds us just how important it is to take time to stop, and breath, and be thankful.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Gratitude is spiritual magic.</strong> Any one who has ever embarked on a Gratitude program or project can attest to the transformation it brings into your life. Perhaps it doesn’t change anything in your life other than your perception – so <strong>nothing changes, yet everything changes</strong>. I think that’s how it was for me when, for my 30<sup>th</sup>birthday, my best friend gave me a gratitude journal. It had 5 lines for each day so I could record 5 things that I was grateful for. At the end of that year, I can’t say that my “situation” was much different, but I was different. I had new eyes. They were opened to what was good in every day, in my life, and in others. I can be critical, picky, detail-oriented… great if you’re looking for an editor, not as helpful in relationships. Gratitude is the antidote for me for my harsh tendencies. It changes my perspective, and softens my approach.</p>
<div id="attachment_7532" class="wp-caption alignright" style="width: 310px">
<img class="size-medium wp-image-7532" title="Thank you2" src="Thank-you2-300x281.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="281"><p class="wp-caption-text">I took this double rainbow photo last year while at a lake house for vacation on Cayuga Lake in New York’s Finger Lakes area. Something about being on the water makes it easy for me to be grateful every day – and this picture brings it right back… Gratitude!</p>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I have been inspired and blessed by the gratitude projects of others as well. A big one recently was A Hundred Thank Yous by my dear friend, artist Lori Portka. She created 100 paintings for 100 people she was grateful for. After a gorgeous exhibition of all 100 pieces, they were given or mailed to the people she painted them for<strong> – </strong>including one for ME! I have seen things open and transform in her life as a result of that monumental undertaking. And I saw how she was taken care of financially and otherwise while doing that soulful work. <strong>It was a true reflection of her heart and her talents – of course that would be supported by Angels/ Spirit / God / all forces in the Universe!<strong></strong><strong></strong></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">To back up one degree, Lori was inspired by Hailey Bartholomew and her 365 Grateful project, in which she took a Polaroid photograph of one thing she was grateful for each day for a year. Not only did it <strong>lift her out of depression but drastically improved her marriage and has taken her life in a new, exciting direction!</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>What might happen if you committed to 30 days, 60 days or 365 days of Gratitude in your own way?! </strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Probably Magic.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #00ccff;"><strong><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-6261" title="Friendship Lisa McDaniel Brown" src="Friendship-Lisa-McDaniel-Brown.jpg" alt="healthy tips, healthy food advice,girlfriend guru" width="230" height="232">Sugar is four times more addictive than cocaine. It’s more toxic than alcohol and tobacco.</strong></span></p>
<h3>Have you noticed all the candy commercials on tv? And the huge displays of candy in the grocery store? And the enormous bowl of tempting treats on my co-worker’s desk? There are days when I am reasonably sure I gain 10 pounds just by getting up in the morning.</h3>
<p><strong>The big problem is that it doesn’t end after the sticky little goblins and ghosts have gone to bed. As Healthy Eating Guru LISA MCDANIEL BROWN points out, it’s the start of  Sugar Season (although as far as I’m concerned sugar season goes at least through Valentine’s Day if not longer…</strong></p>
<p><strong> I feeling the urge to not give in this year. To take more control. To not dive headfirst into the bowl of KitKats and M&amp;Ms. To not rationalize that it’s OK to eat Reece’s because they have peanut butter and that is protein. I’m a little afraid of that commitment. I’m afraid I won’t make it. What are your tips for surviving Sugar Season, girlfriend?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Every October when Halloween comes around it marks the unofficial beginning of the holiday season. It’s Halloween, then Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, and New Year’s. October also marks the beginning of what I’ve always called the <em>“Sugar Season.”</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>DUN DUN DUN!</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">From now until January, you will find SUGAR EVERYWHERE.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7477" title="candy, finding sugar everywhere" src="candy-179x300.jpg" alt="sugar is more addictive than cocaine" width="227" height="380"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First, it’s the Halloween candy – M&amp;M’s, Snickers, Kit Kats, Three Musketeers, and my all-time childhood favorite, Smarties, are just a few of the fabulous, sugary creations you’ll find everywhere from now until the end of the year. Candy is in offices, businesses, grocery stores, your home, your family’s homes — IT’S INESCAPABLE.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Then, a few weeks later, it’s time for Thanksgiving, our annual gorge-fest where we are <em>expected </em>to overeat. To eat until we can’t eat anymore. To eat until it hurts. Then, we wait a little while, and eat some more. Leftovers, yum.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That’s followed by holiday parties – every weekend leading to Hanukkah and Christmas it’s my guess that you have more parties to go to than you have time for. And each of these festivities features lots of food and lots of SUGAR.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>WHAT’S A GIRL TO DO?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">First of all, prepare. Plan ahead. Know that there is going to be a lot of candy and junk available to you that you should really avoid — and decide <em>not to eat</em> handful after handful. Or plateful after plateful.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If necessary employ the AVOIDANCE technique.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If I have a coworker who always has candy in their office, I find a way to STAY OUT of their office. I’m serious. I’ll email them or pick up the phone rather than have to walk past their bowls of M&amp;M’s, candy corn, and mini Reeses (I’m talking to you Betsy B).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If I’m going to a party, I’ll be sure to eat before I go so I’m not starving when I get there. It makes it much easier to pass on unhealthy choices when I don’t have any room for them.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My best advice for staying away from sugar and unhealthy treats this holiday season is to <strong>keep it out of your life, don’t buy it, don’t bring it home,</strong> don’t bake sugary treats weekend after weekend, and don’t bring it into the office for your coworkers to share.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do I sound like a Grinch?? Bah Humbug?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’m really not a Grinch, I’m just a girl who eats too much sugar (I call it an addiction because once I start I have a hard time stopping, and I crave it).<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7478" title="water, drink water to be healthy" src="water-300x179.jpg" alt="drink water to avoid overeating" width="300" height="179"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As a healthy eating coach I know <strong>sugar is four times more addictive than cocaine. It’s more toxic than alcohol and tobacco.</strong> Yet, we eat it every day, and even worse, we feed it to our kids, <em>in abundance</em>. Happy Holidays!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">You don’t have to indulge or overindulge for the next two months just because it’s there. Start your new year’s resolution now and be kind to your body. Feed yourself nutritious veggies, fruits, whole grains, lean meats, legumes, and nuts. And don’t forget to drink <strong>lots</strong> of water.<img class="alignright  wp-image-7476" title="organic food, healthy food choices" src="organic-179x300.jpg" alt="healthy food " width="257" height="430"></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Do these things for yourself and you will truly have a happy, holiday season!</p>

<h2>We love celebrations at Girlfriendology. Sometimes we celebrate little things, but sometimes we get to celebrate big things. Today is one of the days for celebrating a big thing.</h2>
<p><strong>We are delighted announce that Girlfriend Guru Rachel Awes has published her new book (woo hoo!!!!!). For anyone who has found life events occasionally overwhelming and been grateful for girlfriends who understand, this story of her book launch is for you.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Last weekend I hosted a pre-order book and art party out of our home. My book “all i did was listen,” four years in the making, is finally ready to be published.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The people who came were generous with kindness, enthusiasm, and orders. The buzz in our living room was palpable.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The next morning my dear friend Annie came over. She wasn’t able to make it and wanted to pre-order a book and check out my other art for sale.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By the time she showed up at nine, I had already been up for six hours. So much to do. Printing and marketing and last edits on my book and, and, and… I realized my body was mildly shaking when I saw her. <strong>I shared this with her and I deeply appreciated her response.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-7394" title="All i did was listen rachel awes" src="All-i-did-was-listen-rachel-awes-300x300.jpg" alt="girlfriend guru, friendship advice" width="300" height="300"></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Annie wanted to know what she could do for me. I didn’t know how to respond. The things on my list were things only I could do, or someone with very specific computer skills! She continued anyway. She said that she had an extra twenty minutes right then and could do my dishes. She said she would text me when she was on the way to Target or to get groceries and would ask me what I need…or how about laundry?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I haven’t taken her up yet on this, but her fierce presence calmed down my shaking.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>I am grateful to have her in my life as both a friend and a beautiful role model.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">XOX sending out love to all that’s in your piles and shaking and being, Rachel</p>

<h2>After serious scientific research (I asked the dog for his opinion), I’ve decided that there are several different kinds of knitters. There are those that want to be knitters but have never learned (this is a great blog for you). There are those who are happy to be around knitters so long as no one actually asks them to pick up a piece of yarn (you too, keep reading). There are those of us who can manage a straight row–sort of (this is such a good blog for you). There are those of us who plunge recklessly into projects that somehow never seem to get finished (read on, girlfriend). And there are those who create absolutely gorgeous knitted items that are eagerly pounced upon by pretty much everyone (definitely a blog for you!).</h2>
<p><strong>Girlfriend and guest blogger ASHLEY ENERIZ shares some great ideas for starting a knitting club. No matter what category of knitter you are, a knitting club can be a great way to bring girlfriends together. And who knows, maybe even finish a project.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Knitting is definitely not just a craft for grandmas anymore. Knitting popularity has spread down to kids, teens, and even men! If you have a passion for knitting, then why not start a club with others who are just equally as passionate? Starting a knitting club is a great way to get your gab session in with your girlfriends, and you get something done. That is why women are so great – we can multitask everything!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Benefits of a Knitting Club</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Starting a knitting club is a great opportunity for you to connect with others on a social level.</p>
<ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
<li>When I had started a knitting club a few years back, I made many new friends through my knitting club.</li>
<li>Even though you know how to knit, you might run into someone who is better than you that can teach you a new trick.</li>
<li>Also, another benefit for me when I started the club was teaching people how to knit. It was a great experience to be able to help others learn something new.</li>
<li>It is the perfect way to power through your Christmas list.</li>
<li>You can also donate your creations to families in need.</li>
<li>It is proven that getting together with girlfriends often helps women become better cleaners of the kitchen while improving their cooking skills (scientists are still trying to prove this study through intensive research).</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Where to Get Members:</strong> Start with your girlfriends, even the ones that do not know how to knit. Everyone can be taught. Announce your club at your church or local mom’s groups too. It is good to get about 5-10 members; any more could be a little overwhelming.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How to Get Started:</strong> Announce the club wherever you want the members to come from. You can announce orally or just post up flyers and signs. Be sure to have a meeting space arranged and number where they can sign up. Also include any fees they may need for snacks or materials. The best clubs usually meet once a week to once every other week. This keeps the club flowing, without stepping on everyone’s toes for time. Everyone should bring her own yarn and needles. However, I must add that I started my knitting club for charity and local businesses and individuals were kind enough to donate yarn and needles. All I had to do was ask.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>A Lively Club:</strong> If you decided to start a club where not everyone knows each other, be helpful in breaking the ice and encouraging people to connect. As the club starter, you are also the club hostess. It is your job to get the club going. To break the ice, you can all start to talk about your funny experiences of just beginning to knit or something you all have common ground. If you have trouble finding a common ground, try starting off with a quick game before knitting. Keep their mouths busy with yummy snacks or conversation, their hands busy with knitting, and their ears busy with either music or more conversation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Knitting is a great way to connect with girlfriends. Since your hands do all the work almost without any thought behind it, you can talk or even watch a movie while knitting up a storm.</p>

<p>It’s been a wild week. The election brought out drama and differences. Negativity, on ads and in social media, went rampant and impacted friendships. Hopefully now, we can get back to just working together to make life better for us, our friends, our children. Hopefully now, we can all work for the best.</p>
<p>One of the lessons of the week for me was ‘ <strong>a year from now, what will you remember?</strong>‘</p>
<p>It’s a great question to ask when confronted with a decision. Like how to respond to someone you have a difference of opinion with, or when presented with two options involving friends. What will you remember in November 2013? or January 2015?</p>
<h3>Plus … a year from now, what will you wish you’d started today? What’s stopping you? DO IT!</h3>
<p>You’ve got 365 days (aka: 525,600 minutes in the coming year) to make a difference. To make a friend, To be a friend. Use them wisely!</p>
<p>525,600 Minutes</p>

<h3>I don’t remember buying my first bra. I remember getting my first “training bra” in a box of hand-me-downs. Pink, stretchy lace that pulled on over my head. I thought I was the most sophisticated thing on the planet. But somehow I don’t remember ever shopping for a bra (although I must have) until I was in my 20s and went to a great little boutique where the women could look at anyone, no matter how many sweaters and coats, and know–exactly–what size and style they should wear. And where they always came into the dressing room to tuck you into whatever they’d picked out of the special drawers they kept all the bras in.</h3>
<p><strong>Girlfriend Guru and lingerie expert Miss Kitty Plum reminds us that buying a bra can be an uncomfortable experience–especially if it is a first time fitting. She gives us great advice for taking daughters, nieces, granddaughters on a lingerie shopping experience that won’t be fraught with embarrassment and uncomfortable stares. What advice do you have for bra shopping, girlfriend? And what do you remember about the first time you bought a bra?</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>How was your buying trip for your first bra? </strong> If it was anything like mine and most of the women I speak to it was probably a bit awkward and embarrassing.  For some it is such a trauma it puts them off getting fitted again and they spend years hurriedly picking up bras off the rails and putting up with bras that pinch and squeeze rather than repeat the experience. If you have a daughter, niece, or other burgeoning young lady in your care you can do a lot to make sure their first bra fitting trip is a positive experience</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Lead by example. </strong>If the first time in a lingerie department or shop is when you go for a fitting the whole experience can be rather daunting.  Take her with you when you go lingerie shopping so she is used to the layout, the shop assistants, and has an idea of what the process involves.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>2. </strong><strong>Do A Test Run. </strong>When was the last time you went for a fitting?  Are you sure you are wearing the right size?  If you haven’t been fitted within the last two years or aren’t confident you have been fitted correctly then do some research and find a store that fits well and has a fitter that puts you at your ease.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>3. </strong><strong>Don’t Rush. </strong>It can be tough to find the time for a shopping trip for just the two of you but try not to use the opportunity to fit every in errand that you haven’t had chance to do in the last 6 months.  Ideally if you can set aside the time to just go to the lingerie store and then maybe go for lunch it means that neither of you are feeling flustered or agitated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>4. </strong><strong>Brief the fitter. </strong>Explain to the fitter that this is a first fitting and that the bras that are required are for under school shirts, sport, etc.  This should result in the choice of a selection of practical bras rather than anything too pretty or frilly.  Professional fitters are used to dealing with young clients and appreciate that racy and lacy are not appropriate!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <strong>5.  </strong><strong>Respect her privacy</strong>.  Tempting as it maybe to wade into the fitting room to see what is going on try and restrain yourself.  I know I was relieved when my mother left me to it! Most young ladies will want a second opinion but let them ask for it. If you can avoid getting teary and saying “my baby is all grown up” that will reduce the embarrassment factor all around!</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">These tips will hopefully help make the bra buying trip a success and an experience to remember for all the right reasons.  I’d love to hear your stories about your first fitting in the comments below.</p>
