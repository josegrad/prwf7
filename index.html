It’s Spring – the season to put away those winter sweaters and boots, and update our wardrobe with some 2012 Spring Fashion advice!</h3>
<p><strong>Thankfully we’ve got our fashion guru and </strong><strong>Girlfriend Guru DONNA GAMACHE to get us dressed for Spring 2012!</strong> Here’s her always great girlfriend fashion advice on colors and trends for our wardrobe this Spring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If fashion really is a barometer of the times, <strong>we’re in for a colorful, spirited, happy-go-lucky spring/summer 2012</strong>? says The Fashion Group Foundation in its Ready-To-Wear report. After getting through the winter months <strong>this sure sounds good to me … how about you?</strong></p>
<p>If you are wondering what to add to your wardrobe to keep it current this spring/summer, take a look at this<span id="more-5037"></span> list of what are going to be key colors and designs for the season. Remember, whatever you choose to add to your wardrobe it must be in your personal style and shape. <strong>Personal style always trumps runway fashion</strong> so use this list as a guideline for what is current and what you might add to your wardrobe this spring and summer.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Color</strong> is key with <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">tangerine</span> leading the way for the season and green, yellow and red close behind</strong>. On the opposite end of the spectrum, pastels are also really in for the season. Choose the color that works best for your skin tones.</li>
<li> It’s <strong>all about the prints</strong> this upcoming season and we’re seeing some unlikely patterns like <strong>florals</strong> and <strong>tropicals</strong>. <strong>Gingham</strong> and <strong>paisley</strong> are coming back in a new way as well as scarf and photo prints.</li>
<li> <strong>Pleats, pleats, and more pleats</strong> remain in trend (knife, accordion, box, inverted, and more).</li>
<li> <strong>Lace is showing up everywhere</strong>. So look for lace on handbags, shoes, tights, and more.</li>
<li> <strong>Color blocking</strong> is essential for the season in everything from tops, skirts, jackets, and dresses. Color-block your own look by combining contrasting complimentary colors. For example, pair a turquoise pant with a tangerine top—then add a red belt. Not that bold? Then just add a contrasting color to one of your outfits…a yellow dress with a pair of purple shoes will work.</li>
<li> <strong>Pearls are a must have </strong>and appear in necklaces, earrings, bracelets, hairpieces, and more.</li>
<li> Also hot for the season is <strong>vintage-inspired jewelry and crosses</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once again, remember that no matter...</p>

<p><strong> Girlfriend Guru, </strong><strong>ARLETT HARTIE, author Chasing Joy, </strong><strong>points out that this is probably not an accident (nor is it an act of rebellion against our sisters). We simply tend to become and remain friends with women who reflect our personality traits (or the personality traits we’d like to have).</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A week or so ago I was reading my bloggie friend Morgan Dragonwillow’s blog, Shadow Rhythms. In her post Creating a Change – Weightloss Wednesday she mentioned how <strong>we tend to <span id="more-5013"></span>make friends with people who reflect our own personalities as in friends mirroring each other</strong>. This was such an interesting statement. It led me to reflect on my own friendships and I have to agree.  <strong>I have been blessed with many girlfriends during my life, some closer than others but all serving a unique and valuable purpose.</strong> When I look at their personalities now and at the times when we were the closest I definitely see a mirroring effect. Sometimes the mirroring reflects my actually personality being similar to theirs and other times the mirroring reflects their personalities being similar to how I would like my personality to be, being similar to ways <strong>I am trying to grow and push out the walls of my comfort zone.</strong></p>
<p>Like most people <strong>my first group of girlfriends was a direct result of geography.</strong> They lived in my neighborhood and went to my school. However, there were other little girls in my neighborhood and school. When I think about why I became friends with them initially and why I am still friends with them it is very basic, simple, and based on the most innocent set of values that we all start out with. They were nice girls. They did not hit when they played or steal my toys. They did not get me in trouble.  They understood when I told them my mom or dad said I could not do something. These are all the same personality traits that I had as a child (and still have by the way): kind, respectful, moral, and loyal. We all still have these traits, are still in touch, and friends.</p>
<p>When I got older into my teen years I did not make any new meaningful friendships. There were some girls that I spent my school days talking to. But no best girlfriends type of relationships developed. When I think about this form the mirroring perspective, it makes a lot of sense. The girls that I was friendly with were all “on...</p>

We’re thrilled when they take our advice, but usually not offended when they choose another option. After all, the best fashion comes from feeling great about how we’re dressed, right?</h3>
<p><strong>But there are times when we feel almost compelled to offer an opinion–even when we haven’t been asked to share our point of view. Guest blogger MARCIA CASERTA shares her thoughts about <span style="color: #ff6600;">how, </span></strong><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>when, </strong></span><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">and whether </span>to tell a friend what you think about her outfit.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think we all have the friend who is a little bit, shall we say, lost when it comes to fashion. Most of my girlfriends love to go shopping with me, but I have one friend who hates <span id="more-5035"></span>shopping, hates clothes, hates shoes (yes, it’s true), and her appearance shows it. She is a wonderful person and very pretty, but <strong>she simply isn’t interested in fashion</strong>. She could look great if she really tried, but that’s easier said than done with this girl. We considered signing her up for <strong><em>What Not to Wear</em></strong> so Stacy and Clinton could get a hold of her, but I think she’d rather hear it from her girlfriends.</p>
<p>This can be tough. I went to meet this friend for lunch and she was wearing a frumpy sweatshirt with over-sized jeans. In my head I was screaming “That isn’t flattering on you and you look out of place at this cute little café!” but I kept it to myself. I have jokingly talked to her about her appearance, but she just brushes it off and laughs. I decided to consider the pros and cons in my head:</p>
<p><strong>Tell Her She Looks Bad Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> In the long run, she will gain confidence. Girls always feel more confident when they look nice because people treat them with respect.</li>
<li>  People will not be judging her when she walks into a room under-dressed.</li>
<li> She might not realize that she can look so great, so she might be flattered that you helped her.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tell Her You Hate Her Outfit Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> This could be extremely insulting. For all I know, maybe my friend thinks she looks great and already has that confidence and sense of beauty.</li>
<li> There could be another reason that my friend dresses the way she does. If there is a financial burden that I don’t know about, I could really bring my friend down.</li>
<li> She should be able to dress how she...</li>

<p><strong>The Faux Diet Queen (or as we affectionately call her, FDQ) has agreed to share her latest (and last) weight loss journey with us as a regular feature at Girlfriendology. We hope you’ll join us to cheer her on, nudge her back on track when she strays, and generally giggle along.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I was young, there was a big fuss about the “New Math.” Newspapers (<strong>definition: the paper things you don’t have to click when you want to turn a page</strong>) wrote about it, parents ranted about it, Tom Lehreh even wrote a song about it. Most of us didn’t actually get what they were all talking about. We had never been taught Old Math so New Math wasn’t so much New as it was just …. Math.</p>
<p>The point is, here we are almost (age censored out) years later, and FINALLY —today—I <span id="more-5058"></span>figured out the New Math. Pay attention, please.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>OS = GD – MT </strong><strong>à PP<sup>2</sup> = MT</strong></span></p>
<p>For those of you with rusty math skills, allow me to interpret: <strong>Over Sleeping equals Getting Dressed without Much Thought leads to Problem Pants </strong>(<strong><span style="color: #800080;">definition: pants that are slightly too snug</span></strong>) <strong>which yields Muffin Top.</strong> Simple, right?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I the blouse I grabbed covered a Multitude of Sins (<strong>definition: Muffin Top</strong>), and I didn’t have to spend the day worrying that my belt would spontaneous burst and put out someone’s eye.</p>
<p>I called my very mathematically-oriented gal pal Jenny because I thought she would get a kick out of this new interpretation. She listened to the whole theory and said, “But can you breathe?” <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Jenny is a good friend; she is very practical about things like oxygen.</strong></span></p>
<p>It turns out that I’m not the only one with a new approach to math. Have you noticed what companies are doing to nutrition labels? When they say that a <strong>piece of cookie the size of a Cheerio is a ‘serving,’</strong> I just want to bust out laughing!</p>
<p>On the other hand, some companies list a serving size as five (count ‘em, five) cookies. <strong>What mom ever told a kid that five cookies was one serving???</strong> “Come on, mom, just five more cookies.” Nope, never heard that in my house.</p>
<p>I also discovered another product playing New Math games. This well known brand makes stuff you add to water to make it taste good without adding g’dillions (<strong>definition: lots</strong>) of calories. They started by making the stuff in tubs you add to a gallon of water, but they have moved with the times and now make the handy little...</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>I was just </strong></span><strong>out for dinner with a dear girlfriend.</strong> I was sharing my anticipation about speaking at a women’s retreat soon. I told her how I get so anxious when I speak to groups, and also how I want to work through this and simply enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>She emailed me the next week and asked the date and time I would be speaking.</strong> She said she would like to pray for me during this time. She added that she has been praying for me even now … for clarity, vision, and peace in my preparation.</p>
<p><strong>To think that someone in this whole <span id="more-5006"></span>big world would care about my nervous system. </strong>My little bits of worry. My hope. My heart. And even pay attention to the clock of when all this in me might rise up the most. <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>I can’t imagine a greater gift. </strong></span>I want to take this gift in, and respond to it when I speak. I want to picture my sweet girlfriend praying for me. I want this knowledge to soften my heart. I want this knowledge to change me. And with this gift, I can imagine feeling calmer. I am so grateful.<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5007" title="Rachel Awes prayer to the wall 96" src="Rachel-Awes-prayer-to-the-wall-96.jpg" alt="Girlfriend prayer,overcoming fear, helping girlfriends" width="420" height="483"></p>
<p><strong>There are many words that can convey a similar gift to a girlfriend.</strong> In addition to asking “when can I pray for you?” we could also offer to hold each other in our hearts or in the light during a particular time. We could offer to be alongside our friend in person at a given time, if it is possible. We could write a poem or paint a picture for our friend at a relevant hour. <strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">The timing does matter.</span> And so does the love we have to offer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I’m sending love out now to each of you readers. For just when you need it. xo.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hello from beautiful Napa!</strong> I’m here in a fabulous hotel, with wonderful wine and a menu that would lure any foodie to never, ever leave. I’m part of the <strong>First Annual Wine Sisterhood Gathering</strong>. It’s a <strong>wonderful pairing of wine and women</strong> that promises to be a fabulous, friend-filled event hosted by the wonderful women in the <strong>WINE SISTERHOOD</strong>. (I’ll tell you more about it below. I just have to apologize for gloating about it! I’m giddy to be here!) (Those are two of my beautiful friends here – Aliza and Danielle.)</p>
<p><strong>Yes, it’s an amazing event and I can’t wait to meet more of the fabulous females who are here – several of whom are bloggers that I’m sure we’re going to bond over! <img src="icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></strong></p>
<p>Now back to that <span id="more-5048"></span><strong>weird collision of life and happiness </strong>mentioned above … I landed yesterday, ready to meet us with five other ‘Wine Sisters’ for the drive to Napa and picked up an email that completely stopped me in my rush through SFO airport. The terrible news that I assumed would come eventually came. A kind, beautiful, funny neighbor had lost her brave battle with breast cancer. She leaves behind a wonderful husband and dad to their two young children (who often play on our sidewalk and amuse us with their cuteness!).</p>
<p>So, I’m heading to a wonderful women and wine event and <strong>reality strikes</strong>. Our neighborhood is in mourning. Our friend has lost his dear wife and reached out for help to find a place for the memorial.It was definitely surreal for him but also for me – realizing the impact of how life changed for our friends while I floated above the U.S. on my way to wine and food mecca. Thinking about the extremes we go through – from happiness to deep sadness, the range of emotions we women feel, I am SO GRATEFUL for my dear GIRLFRIENDS.</p>
<h3>I’m thankful for the amazing friends in my life who are there for me when I’m happy and when I’m sad. So grateful for girlfriends.</h3>
<p><strong>I hope your day is more on the happy than sad side today</strong>. But either way I wish the blessing of BFFs who will be there to share wine or even when you whine. (: Be grateful today – for your girlfriends, for your health, for a warm home and a community who care.</p>

Are you have an Oscars party? And … Who is your Best Supporting BFF?</h3>
<p>Actually, just because we’re giddy to share, I’m going to be in Napa on Sunday night watching the Oscars with the fab female bloggers and other women attending the <strong>Wine Sisterhood’s First Annual Wine Gathering</strong>. It’s going to be GREAT! And, I’m very happy that we’re having a girlfriend party to watch the awards. You know that is going to be FUN!</p>
<p>Every year I have an Academy Awards party so I couldn’t help but think about what I’d do if I were home for the Oscars. Here’s a few ideas (and hopefully inspiration!) on <strong>throwing a Girlfriend Party for the 2012 Academy Awards:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>THEME IT</strong> – Think about the <span id="more-5045"></span>films up for <strong>Best Picture: The Artist, War Horse, The Help, Moneyball, Midnight in Paris</strong>, etc (Here’s a full <strong>list of all the 2012 Oscar nominees</strong>). Which ones are your favorites and which might lend themselves to a food, decorations or overall party theme? Have fake money and baseballs on the table for Moneyball. Serve chocolate pie and fried chicken for The Help. Decorate with the Eiffel Tower for Midnight in Paris, etc. Or, just get photos off the internet of the top movies and print them out for decorations.</li>
<li> <strong>FOOD</strong> – For anyone who has read or seen <strong>The Help</strong>, again – serving chocolate pie would be hilarious! (Here are some of our reviews of The Help – on <strong>friendship in The Help</strong>, on <strong>being from the south</strong>.) Keep the food themes going – Hawaiian pizza for the <strong>Descendents</strong>, Baseball foot (hot dogs, etc.) for Moneyball, French Onion Soup for Midnight in Paris – you get ‘<em><strong>the picture</strong></em>.’ hehehe</li>
<li> <strong>DRESS CODE</strong> – Since <strong>The Artist</strong> is in black and white, you could tell your friends to dress in black and white – or ask that everyone add a splash of gold to their attire or accessories for Oscar gold.</li>
<li> <strong>RED CARPET</strong> – You might not have that handy but you could throw a red towel or blanket in front of your threshold and even take a <strong>paparazzi</strong> shot of friends as they enter – make sure you have a flash to make it bright and paparazzi-ish (: Or, if you have some kid’s chalk, color the side walk in red or draw Oscar on your walkway.  Find ways to set the stage before they even enter your house.</li>
<li> <strong>AWARDS</strong> – Why not <strong>give awards to your ‘Best Supporting...</strong>

The Faux Diet Queen shares some of her ideas for creating small bits of self-indulgent time.</h3>
<p><strong>The Faux Diet Queen (or as we affectionately call her, FDQ) has agreed to share her latest (and last) weight loss journey with us as a regular feature at Girlfriendology. We hope you’ll join us to cheer her on, nudge her back on track when she strays, and generally giggle along.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800080;">Rituals are important</span> in our lives. </strong></p>
<p>I’m not talking about religious rituals, although those are important too.  I’m talking about the <strong>“me time” rituals. The time we build into our crazy busy lives to take just a few minutes off from caring for others to take care of ourselves.</strong></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, that “me” time has changed over the years. At one time, it was<span id="more-5030"></span> watching LA Law. No one, but no one, called me on Thursday nights from 10pm to 11pm. They knew better. The first time my Eventually To Be Hubby called me it was during a new episode of L.A. Law. How he managed to stay in my life after that breach of etiquette is still one of <strong>Life’s Great Mysteries</strong>.</p>
<p>From TV, my Do Not Disturb time moved on to Baby Bath Time. World shaking events could have occurred during bath time (they never did, but they could have) and I would have said they just needed to wait until we’d washed all the appropriate fingers, toes, and belly buttons.</p>
<p><span style="color: #800080;"><strong>Now my Luxury Time is drinking my morning coffee. </strong></span></p>
<p>My life is so busy right now that carving out five minutes to sit in silence is about all I can manage on a daily basis.</p>
<p>My current favorite is Boresha Fat Burning Coffee (thanks to Girlfriendology’s own Judi Cogen for introducing me to it!). It tastes great and it burns fat. What more could you possibly want?</p>
<p>The important part for me is less what is In the Cup, and more the Cup itself. Not the actual cup. Cups in my house tend to be whatever someone has given us, and (more than likely) by now have a chip or two on the bottom or the handle.</p>
<p>It’s <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>the Fact</strong></span> of the Coffee Cup. <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>The Time</strong></span> of the Coffee Cup. <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>The Cup</strong></span> that says, “You can have my attention in a minute or two, but for right now, I am coffee-focused.” <span style="color: #800080;"><strong>The Mug</strong></span> that says, “Seriously, I mean it. If someone isn’t about to lose a limb or commit a felony, it will just have to...</p>

<img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5017" title="Girlfriendology Traffic cars driving" src="Girlfriendology-Traffic-cars-driving.jpg" alt="Girlfriendology Traffic cars driving" width="230" height="232">How is a morning commute like my girlfriends? What do friends and freeways have in common?</h3>
<p>I work from home, generally, so this morning’s commute to an early social media event threw off my schedule a bit. Instead of walking a few feet to my home office, I drove several miles downtown, in the dark (I’m ready for Spring!), and in the rain.</p>
<p>As I sped along, wanting to get there in plenty of time to chat with my social media buddies, I was conscious of the cars nearby and how the slightest swerve or blind spot, could radically change my life and possibly so many others. I thought about how driving is just one example of <strong>having to trust others – having faith</strong> that they pay attention to their and my safety, that they focus on the cars around them, the road conditions, the weather and that we all stay in our proper lanes.</p>
<p>We put our faith in strangers everyday, in so many ways. Every time we <span id="more-5018"></span>drive, whenever we go for a medical procedure, each time we cross the street, fly or even take a cruise, we are trusting that people we most likely don’t know are looking out for our safety and best interest. That’s a whole lot of faith getting us through this wild road of life.</p>
<p>In addition to ‘trust,’ driving a busy byway of distracted people like myself, ‘<strong>grace</strong>‘ came to mind as well. We (hopefully!) give each other grace – to change directions (or, our minds), to accidentally slip into another lane (or slip up), and for not paying attention (or showing attention).  Grace is a necessity – because we’re all busy, distracted, sometimes confused and merely human.</p>

<strong> <img class="size-medium wp-image-3511 alignleft" title="Girlfriends with girlfriendology gerbera daisy flower 1" src="Girlfriends-with-girlfriendology-gerbera-daisy-flower-1-200x150.jpg" alt="Girlfriends with girlfriendology gerbera daisy flower" width="200" height="150"><strong>Where would we be without trust and grace? </strong>
<p></p></strong><strong> </strong>
</h3>
<p>I wouldn’t want to drive on the roads, eat food others created/prepared, travel or get medical care – and I wouldn’t have the amazing blessing of friends in my life.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s be thankful for the trust and grace we all share</strong> as we drive, shop, explore, learn and all the situations of our life. And let’s be especially aware of <strong>the blessing of friends</strong> who we can trust and who show us unlimited grace. Let’s stop and be conscious of the wonderful world we live in and be happy. That’s what your (trusting, trustworthy and grace-filled) friends want you to be. <strong>Be Happy. And be thankful for Trust and Grace.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Mix women and wine and you’ve got a wonderful time – right?</strong> Well, that was definitely true last week when I was in Napa for the <strong>First Annual Gathering of the Wine Sisterhood</strong> with great women from the worlds of wine and social media. (<strong>Thanks Wine Sisterhood for this great event!</strong> This is a photo of my beautiful girlfriends Danielle and Aliza, as well my full review of the Wine Sisterhood ‘custom blend of women and wine!‘)</p>
<p>LISTEN to our <strong>BlogTalkRadio interview with Mary Ann</strong> of the Wine Sisterhood – great inspiration for sharing wine and/or travel with a girlfriend!</p>
<p>(And while we’re talking women and wine, here’s a great guest blog post that the Wine Sisterhood wrote for us – on <strong>pairing wine with <span id="more-5075"></span>books</strong>. Fun ‘reading for your book club!’)</p>
<p>Actually <strong>any time with girlfriends is a great time</strong> – whether we’re talking, laughing, drinking wine, eating, or even for those hopefully rare times when we’re crying together – we’re sharing our lives, and that’s a wonderful thing and a great time. <strong>We’re all about spending time with our great girlfriends</strong> – new and old, drinking wine or taking a walk, wine women or social media ’sistas.’</p>
<h3>Speaking of Time … Leap Day and the Time Change (and time for a change?!)</h3>
<p><strong>What did you do with your BONUS Leap Day this year?</strong> Did you spend February 29th with a friend? Did you give yourself a little more time to make memories with a friend?</p>
<p><strong>Remember, you can ‘pretend’ it’s February 29th, aka: Leap Day, anytime you need some girlfriend time!</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>A day cometh and an hour goeth away!</em></strong> Don’t forget this that Saturday night is when we ’spring forward’ and lose an hour. (But you can always make it up with a Sunday afternoon nap <img src="icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley"></p>

<p>While we’re talking TIME, it’s March – the time for Women’s History Month.

<p>The WINE SISTERHOOD is a wonderful group of women (and a few select Wine Misterhoods!) who create wonderful wines for women and created an online community where women can join the conversation about wine. (Join their over 100,000 Wine Sisterhood community on Facebook!) We’ve worked with them in the past since so many of us girlfriends enjoy a glass of wine with a friend – conversations just happen, and that’s a good thing!</p>
<p>Shown here are <strong>MARY ANN VANGRIN, TERRY WHEATLEY</strong> and <strong>NATALIE WASSUM</strong> (Co-founders of the Wine Sisterhood). LISTEN to our <strong>BlogTalkRadio interview with Mary Ann</strong> for more info into this great group of women and the fabulous Wine Sisterhood Gathering we shared in Napa last week! (For more info on their wines, check out the video below. And, check out this ‘<strong>pairing of books and wine</strong>‘ that Mary Ann share – great for your Book Club or just your favorite genre.)</p>
<p>I could never <span id="more-5068"></span>cover all of it, there was just too much packed into three days, so here’s the official agenda and some of the great speakers (revised with my comments, from the Wine Sisterhood’s site):<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5070" title="wine sisterhood gathering dirty blonde cocktails" src="wine-sisterhood-gathering-dirty-blonde-cocktails-96x150.jpg" alt="wine sisterhood gathering dirty blonde cocktails" width="96" height="150"></p>
<p><strong>Sunday Evening:</strong> Welcome reception and Oscar Party. (So fun!) Voting and wonderful reception hosted by <strong>DIRTY BLONDE COCKTAILS</strong>. (Yummy premium champagne cocktails, available at Target, etc.! – and created by a wonderful woman, <strong>Kristen Raskopf</strong>. (The Wine Sisterhood Gathering introduced us to so many great women winery experts – like the Mutt Lynch Winery, created by girlfriend Brenda and several more – all fabulous!)</p>

We were welcomed by Wine Sisterhood Founder, Terry Wheatley. Then we had a <strong>great social media session with girlfriend </strong>Web pioneer and digital diva <strong>ALIZA SHERMAN</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" title="lesliesbracco" src="lesliesbracco.png" alt="" width="100" height="100">Then came one of my favorite surprises – <strong>hearing wine corks popping at 10:48 a.m.!</strong> We all smiled as we got a GREAT wine tasting lesson from the FABULOUS Wine expert, author and head Thirsty Girl <strong>LESLIE SBROCCO.</strong> She...</p>

Who are the women we celebrate during this month of gratitude for strong women who opened doors for so many other women? One is MARIAN SPENCER, Civil Rights Activist.</h3>
<p>I had the honor last night to hear Marian Spencer speak at an event hosted by <strong>The Women’s Fund of The Greater Cincinnati Foundation</strong>. She personifies education, strength and beauty. Here’s a little about this inspiring, smart and amazing woman (from The Women’s Fund website):</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<strong>How is history made? Who makes that history? </strong>To look at Marian Spencer you’d never guess that she boldly goes where others fear to tread. Now, in her 90s, Mrs. Spencer has a steely determination that belies her diminutive size.</div>
<p></p>
<div>A long-time civil rights activist, Mrs. Spencer is a Cincinnati icon well known for her <span id="more-5063"></span>tireless advocacy of civil rights and equal treatment of minorities. In 1952, she chaired the NAACP Legal Action vs. Coney Island, Cincinnati, Ohio. The Cincinnati History and Library Archives describes the genesis of this key desegregation action, “The case started when Spencer’s sons heard a radio ad inviting children to Coney Island to meet a local TV personality. She telephoned to ask if the invitation applied to all children and was assured that it did; however, when Spencer added, ‘We are Negroes,’ the Coney Island representative admitted the invitation did not extend to Negro children.” Spencer was dismissed from the entrance by an armed guard on the Fourth of July, 1952. Spencer filed suit and subsequently won the case, which desegregated Coney Island.</div>
<p></p>
<div>For decades, Marian and her husband, Donald, now deceased, were leaders of the efforts to desegregate Cincinnati schools, workplaces and many important community venues.  She has also fought to protect all citizens’ fundamental right to vote for the candidate of their choice. She became Cincinnati’s first African American woman elected to City Council and served as Vice Mayor.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit – <strong>I was in awe of Marian</strong>. At 91 and a half (she said that ‘half’ was important!) she still inspires women (and all of us) to stand up for our beliefs, to bravely work to make things better, and to <strong>care about our country, communities and neighbors</strong>. A few of the wonderful lessons she shared about her life and beliefs:</p>
<ul><li> She was raised in her grandfather’s home, a freed slave. He stressed the need for <strong>education</strong> and she still continues to challenge students to stay in...</li></ul>

<p>We talk about ‘<strong>Girlfriend Gratitude</strong>‘ quite often – appreciating the women in our lives who make everything more fun, who help us go after our dreams, and who take care of our mind, body and spirit. Yes, we love to show and inspire ‘Girlfriend Gratitude’ as often as we can – it’s part of the fabric of friendship!</p>
<p><strong>In the month of March we also stop to be grateful for the women who have gone before us. </strong>For the amazing females who faced adversity, jail, incrimination and more for just asking for equal rights – to vote, to attend schools, be admitted into public pools, to go after jobs and represent our country in politics and even wars. We stop each March to celebrate WOMEN’S HISTORY MONTH. It’s a formal way of feeling ‘girlfriend gratitude’ for women who unselfishly <span id="more-5059"></span>stood up for our rights and opportunities.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-5061" title="Girlfriendology well behaved women stamp" src="Girlfriendology-well-behaved-women-stamp1.jpg" alt="Girlfriendology well behaved women seldom make history, womens quote" width="361" height="337">There’s a lovely quote that seems to resonate with women: <strong>“Well-behaved women seldom make history.”</strong> (Accredited to Laurel Thatcher Ulrich per Wikipedia) It’s popular because it’s true.</p>
<p>To the women who burned bras and marched in protest, to the moms who stand up for the rights of their children to be treated just like other children, to the fabulous females who take on laws, governments, bombs and bullets. <strong>WE ARE GRATEFUL.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let’s celebrate Women’s History Month </strong>by learning more about the women who fought for our freedom and to give us rights we would not have had without them.</p>
<p>And, <strong>let’s show our Girlfriend Gratitude </strong>to the women in our lives today who stand up for us.</p>
<p><strong>And, while we’re at it, let’s allow ourselves to be less than ‘well-behaved’ and let’s show our daughters and other women that we’re still looking out for each other. Be grateful girlfriends. And make some history!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Check back on Girlfriendology this month as we feature more inspiring women for Women’s History Month!<br></strong></p>
<p>p.s. I’m excited to start Women’s History Month at an event tonight by the Women’s Foundation (an arm of the ‘Greater Cincinnati Foundation) with a special guest of <strong>MARIAN SPENCER, civil rights activist</strong> and a mom who stood up for her rights and her children. I...</p>

And here with one more love story is our own Real Estate <strong>Girlfriend Guru</strong> Cathy Perry.</h3>
<p><strong>She is not a fan of Valentine’s Day, but as she tells us in this month’s blog, she loves her home.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>I am, on occasion, a procrastinator</strong>, and I have been badly delinquent in my February submission to Girlfriendology. I spent way more time than I should have trying to figure out how to link something topical about real estate to the major event in February – Valentine’s Day. My challenge was made doubly hard by the fact that <strong>I’ve had an aversion to the day of hearts and flowers</strong> since my divorce from my first husband was finalized on<span id="more-5052"></span> V-Day (hey, when you’ve been separated for over a year before the state allowed you to file for divorce, you take the first court date you can get). And so, despite now being (mostly) happily married for 28 years, I’m still glad when the big day is over.</p>
<p>And so, as the Scrooge of Valentine’s Day, what to write about? I love homes in general, and interior design, which led me to real estate, albeit on a lengthy, meandering path.<strong> What home do I love the most? My own, of course.</strong></p>
<p>We hadn’t planned to buy – or build – a home, until out of the blue a house around the corner that I’d always loved went on the market, and I just had to see if the inside was as lovely as the outside. (It wasn’t.) But the astute agent who showed it to me recognized a golden opportunity, and dropped off the floorplans for a new development a mere two miles away. It was love at first sight!</p>
<p><strong>Everything about that home spoke to me</strong>, just from the floorplan. A center hall colonial, but with a twist of angles that made it unique.  A wall of windows in the family room. A huge kitchen with a good-sized island. And the chance to have a large, level back yard for our boys instead of the ski slope we were currently living on.</p>
<p>And so we built it. And visited it every day while it was under construction. <strong>I’ve tended and nurtured it like a child for over 17 years</strong> (although it would likely say a little more cleaning would be appreciated). I learned to garden, and until my son played competitive baseball that sucked up all the spring and summer hours, I reveled in the feel of dirt under my hands and the sight of blooming hydrangeas. I’m still trying to get the cottage garden back under control after those baseball years let it run wild.</p>
<p><strong>We built memories – good ones, funny ones, painful...</strong></p>

Fortunately, a great girlfriend can make all the difference. A real friend can help us all work through the worst of times (or, if not “work through” then at least accompany us on the journey).</h3>
<p><strong>Leah Downs shares her own unique way of classifying bad experiences and offers some suggestions for how to help a friend having a rotten day.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We all have moments that test our mettle; it’s a clause in the “being human” contract</strong>. To add levity to <span id="more-4940"></span>such moments, I rate them according to their fork-worthiness, as in “It was so bad I wanted to stick a fork in my eye.” I might describe an especially difficult evening as “A Four-Fork Affair.” I did not originate the idea of taking a fork to the eye, but the fork-rating classification system I am about to share (patent pending) is entirely mine.</p>
<p>This classification system is more than a rudimentary tool to cheer yourself after a three-forker. It includes <strong>recommendations for how to best help your friend after a fork-worthy day.</strong></p>
<p>I can neither confirm nor deny whether the classification system examples are from my own life, except to say that, yes, they are.</p>
<p><strong>One-Fork Moments:</strong> One-fork moments are relatively innocuous, happening at least once a day. They hardly warrant a mention, but you can’t patent a numbered classification system that begins with a “two” without raising red flags at the patent office, so I had to include the One-Fork category. Some examples: 1) The nine people ahead of you in the 12-item line at the store fidget and avoid eye contact with the cashier—tell-tale signs they shamelessly conceal at least 10 additional items in their carts. You recognize the signs because it takes one to know one; 2) Traffic is a bear so you zip over to a lane that is moving; your new lane screeches to a stop and, in the lane you just deserted, cars breeze by you mockingly; 3) blah, blah, blah, yada, yada, yada.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>Responses to a Girlfriend’s One-Fork Moment:</strong></span> Because One-Fork moments hardly warrant a mention, I won’t mention them except to say: that’s what friends are for. We listen, we commiserate, we joke–and we assure our girlfriends that we will be there for the next one-fork moment.</p>
<p><strong>Two-Fork Moments: </strong>You take a guy home to meet your parents (the one you think is “The One”) and he enchants your parents in a single afternoon. Certain your siblings will be similarly impressed by your discerning taste, you...</p>

It seems we’re hearing from a lot of girlfriends that they are trying to streamline their homes but having trouble getting rid of the clutter.</h3>
<p><strong>Guest blogger</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and de-cluttering expert DANA WHITE share some of her tips for having a successful girlfriend garage sale</strong> to get rid of the things you really mean to get rid of. LISTEN IN to our previous BlogTalkRadio interview with Dana on reclaiming your house and being more organized and<strong> HERE our NEW BlogTalkRadio.com/Girlfriendology interview as we talk with Dana about de-cluttering our home!<br></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff6600;">Are you looking around at piles of stuff </span>that you purged from your closets and cabinets in January?</strong> Are you wishing a Magical Clutter Fairy would fly through your window and make it all just go away?</p>
<p>There are lots of options <span id="more-4995"></span>for getting rid of your stuff, from giving it away to selling it on online. Having a garage sale is a good choice if you want to make a little money while getting rid of LOTS of stuff at once.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe you’re considering having a garage sale</strong> . . . but you’re scared!  If you’ve ever had one, you know that they require <strong>a lot</strong> of work. You have to dedicate an entire weekend to having the sale, and that’s <strong><em>after</em> </strong>spending weeks or months gathering the things to put in it!</p>
<p>As someone with (way too much) garage sale experience, I can tell you that <strong>the very best way to make your garage sale a positive experience is to have one with a girlfriend! </strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>When you plan your sale with a girlfriend, you have a de-cluttering accountability partner!</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ve probably whined to your best friend about your overflowing closets. Once you decide on a date for your joint sale, you’ll be able to motivate each other to get those spaces cleaned out! <strong>You’ll also have a (loving) voice of reason</strong> to assure you that it really is time to get rid of your purple plaid shorts!</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>A joint sale is more likely to be successful!</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do a garage sale together, <strong>you can choose the best location</strong> and have your sale at the more accessible and easy-to-find house. Advertising as a “Two Family Sale” will also draw more shoppers.</p>
<p>When you have someone to divide the planning duties with, you’re more likely to get it all done. Decide who will make and distribute your signs, who will put an ad in the local newspaper, who will create the Craigslist notice, and who will run by the bank to be sure you have plenty of...</p>

<p><strong>Add a professional situation in and the equation gets even more complicated! </strong><strong>Guest blogger</strong><strong></strong><strong> </strong><strong>AMANDA DISILVESTRO shares her thoughts on getting to know, and becoming friends with, co-workers.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Many of us become friends with the people we work with</strong>. In some cases these become deep lasting friendship (more than just “work friends”), but sometimes we try too hard to form friendships and it goes wrong. As someone who once worked 40 hours per week with all men, I will admit that when a girl was hired to sit next to me I was excited. Sometimes I just need someone to talk about work with. My boyfriend<span id="more-5016"></span> at the time was polite and listed to my work stories, but let’s be honest — he had no idea what I was talking about.</p>
<p>The more I thought about it, the more I wondered if it was a good idea to ask my new co-worker for drinks after work. Could this come off as odd? Furthermore, what if she wasn’t into office gossip (you know you do it!) and reported me to my boss? I have met plenty of people who feel this way, so my excitement suddenly turned to confusion. I wonder if this is how men feel when they ask out a girl…</p>
<p>I decided that girls need a plan of action when they’re considering asking a potential new friend out for drinks:</p>
<p><strong>Three Rules to Follow before Making the “Drinks after Work” Date</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> <em>1. </em><strong><em>Get to know her.</em></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This may sound obvious, but I’ll admit I almost jumped the gun because I was so excited that a girl was finally working at my company. I decided that I first had to see if she was the type of person who I would want to get drinks with after work sometime. I think you can get to know someone at work by asking questions: How was your weekend? Do you have anything planned for tonight? Did you get stuck in traffic yesterday? Seems pretty basic, but the tone of voice and enthusiasm can tell you a lot about whether someone is looking for a friend or likes to keep to themselves.</p>
<ol>
<li> <em>2. </em><strong><em>See if she would be interested in going out for drinks without being too forward. </em></strong>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it might seem silly, it’s important that you don’t create an uncomfortable work environment for yourself. If you asked a girl out for drinks after work and she thought that was strange, you’re going to have to deal with that awkwardness every single day. Ask this potential...</p>

This year, the end of February brings a treat — it’s Leap Year! How are you going to use your extra day, Girlfriend?</h3>
<p><strong>Girlfriend Guru</strong><strong> Jennifer Hall</strong><strong> believes some of that time should be used to stay in touch with friends. Which of these ideas might work for you?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Every four years we get an extra day added to our year. February 29 is a whole extra day!</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are you going to do with it?</strong></p>
<h4>May I suggest you <span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>spend <span id="more-5027"></span>some time with a girlfriend?</strong></span>
</h4>
<p>This year, the 29<sup>th</sup> is a Wednesday, so you may not be able to spend the whole day. However, you could plan a fantastic Girl’s Night!</p>
<p>Or you could simply have a long-overdue phone conversation. The point is, you have an <strong><em>EXTRA DAY </em>and it should not be wasted! (You don’t have to wait until our Sunday ‘Phone a Friend’ day!)<br></strong></p>
<p><strong>You should choose to take this extra time to focus on your friendships because:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> You make excuses why you don’t have the time to call, text, email or get together.</li>
<li> You don’t make excuses, but your friends do.</li>
<li> <strong>Everything else in your life comes first.</strong>
</li>
<li> It’s been way too long.</li>
<li> Your friendships deserve this time over other things because:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why should everything else that normally gets priority get this extra time too?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>It only comes around once every four years.</strong>
</li>
<li> You deserve to spend time with the people who ‘get’ you.</li>
<li> It’s good for you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We should look at Leap Day as <em>FREE TIME</em>. We should take advantage of it, seize the day, grab the bull by the horns….</p>
<p>My unofficially official date night with my bestie is Mexican food and a movie. Do you have a similar recipe for a perfect night out with a friend? A Wednesday is a great night to get out too, because it’s right smack dab in the middle of the week. Getting out on a Wednesday will rejuvenate you for Thursday and Friday and all the hoopla of the weekend.</p>
<p>At least, that’s my story and I’m stickin’ to it!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong>So get in touch with a friend, plan a little something, and do it. And hey, let me know you did!</strong></span></p>

Too bad we don’t grow up to love ourselves the same way. Thankfully we have our girlfriends to remind us of what we can see – that we’re stunning and wonderful!</h3>
<p>Thankfully too, we have our <strong>Girlfriend Guru LISA SARICK</strong> to remind us girlfriends – and our daughters and other ‘little girlfriends’ that <strong>we are beautiful just the way we are</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A super-gorgeous girlfriend of mine called me recently, almost in tears. She and her husband were getting ready to go away for the weekend – well, he WAS ready. She was feeling too fat to feel good in any of her clothes and was lying on her bed. She knew it was irrational. She just didn’t know how to snap out of it.</p>
<p>Did I mention she’s <span id="more-5002"></span>tall, thin, and <strong>gorgeous</strong>?! She’s the woman that walks into a place, with her handsome husband, and we (some of us, at least) think, “If only I had a body like that, or looked like her…”</p>
<p><strong>Even that woman is unhappy with herself sometimes. It makes me sad – even mad</strong>. I’ve seen Miss Representation. Don’t get me started!</p>
<p>I think about my little Cami, age 2.5. She loves her self and her little body. She dances around naked pretty much daily, sings, bosses everyone around – including the dogs. I would hate for her to grow up and feel inhibited. I don’t want her to feel pressured to shrink, or dim her light in any way so that others feel more comfortable. I don’t want her to tie up her worth or her happiness with her dress size.</p>
<h3>
<strong><em>What DO I want her to know</em></strong>; to take in to her being and live from? … and my girlfriends and myself to remember?<strong> </strong>
</h3>
<p><strong>These 10 things:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> 1. Our bodies are <strong>miraculous vehicles</strong> for our journeys on the earth. Let’s be grateful for them and treat them with love.</li>
<li> 2. Healthy bodies come in <strong>different shapes and sizes</strong>.</li>
<li> 3. <strong>We are whole</strong>; much more than a bunch of body parts.<strong> </strong>
</li>
<li> 4. Perfectionism is <strong>violence against the self</strong>, and wasted energy.</li>
<li> 5 .Our bodies respond best to a <strong>friendly attitude</strong>, rather than harshness and punishment.</li>
<li> 6 .What we have to offer the world is <strong>not limited</strong> by our physical appearance.<strong> </strong>
</li>
<li> 7 .There is a <strong>Divine purpose</strong> for our lives – which<strong> <em>probably</em></strong> is not to be a size 2.</li>
<li> 8. Judging other women on the basis of their body size, shape or appearance <strong>hurts us all</strong>.</li>
<li> 9. Beauty is an <strong>inner light</strong> that we allow to shine by being who we are, as fully as possible.</li>
<li> 10. <strong>We are worthy</strong> because we exist.</li>
</ol>
